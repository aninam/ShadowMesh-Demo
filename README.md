# computePlanarShadow Demo
A simple demo showing use of the THREE.Mesh.computePlanarShadow( parentMesh, plane, lightPosition4D ) method <br>
This method takes 3 arguments: 
1. A THREE.Mesh object - the shadow-casting parent mesh
2. A THREE.Plane object - the plane in which the shadow will appear
3. A THREE.Vector4 Object - a 4D vector describing the light's position and whether it is a pointLight or directionalLight. 
<br>
Example usage is detailed in the demo's source.
